<!-- History
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="history">History</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">Originally the codename for an internal 3D engine under development at <a href="http://dotbunny.com">dotBunny</a> in late 2005. The ethos behind its design principles were easily ported over to the Unity game engine by <a href="https://twitter.com/reapazor">@reapazor</a> when the studio fully adopted the then young engine in early 2006.</p>
  <p>On <time datetime="2013-07-24 00:00">July 24, 2013</time> the project was first committed to GitHub as an open sourced project, while the Unity Asset Store release came much later on <time datetime="2013-10-10 00:00">October 10, 2013</time> due to the numerous restrictions placed on distributed packages by Unity.</p>

  <p>This project is about empowering the community to make great content with Unity. Every developer out there at some point has gotten something wonderful from the Unity community. This is "our" way of giving back to the community, and we would love to have your assistance at making it better!

  <p>The fastest way to get Hydrogen into your project is to download the packaged version from the Unity Asset Store. Included in the package is a bunch of example content that demonstrates how the framework <em>may</em> be used.</p>
