  <!-- Getting started
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="download">Download Hydrogen</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Hydrogen has a few easy ways to quickly get started, each one appealing to a different skill level and use case. Read through to see what suits your particular needs.</p>

    <h3 id="download-unity">Unity Asset Store</h3>
    <p>The fastest way to get Hydrogen into your project is to download the packaged version from the Unity Asset Store. Included in the package is a bunch of example content that demonstrates how the framework <em>may</em> be used.</p>
    <p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="{{ site.asset_store }}" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Getting Started', 'Download', 'Unity Asset Store']);" role="button">Open Unity Asset Store</a></p>

    <h3 id="download-clone">GitHub</h3>
    <p>It's only natural that you would use GIT as it is our preferred way of getting access to Hydrogen.
    <div class="bs-docs-dl-options">
      <h4>
        <a href="{{ site.repo }}" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Getting Started', 'Download', 'GIT Clone']);">Clone &amp; Copy</a>
      </h4>
      <p>You can clone a local copy of the repository that you simply copy files from into your project.</p>
      <p>This method is a bit messy, but for some people it works. Just make sure that you do not use this method into the middle of your project. If you are using any of the version control systems in Unity this can cause some major grief.</p>
      {% highlight bash %}$ git clone https://github.com/dotBunny/Hydrogen.git Hydrogen{% endhighlight %}
      <h4>
        <a href="{{ site.repo }}" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Getting Started', 'Download', 'GIT Submodule']);">Submodule For The Win</a>
      </h4>
      <p>This is by far the best way in our opinion to get Hydrogen into your project, and allows for it to stay up-to-date the easiest. If you are using a GIT client you will need to refer to how that particular client allows you to add submodules.</p>
      <p>If you are feeling awesome, which you must be, as your wanting to use Hydrogen, then this is the option for you.</p>           
      {% highlight bash %}$ git submodule add https://github.com/dotBunny/Hydrogen.git "Assets/Stock Assets/Hydrogen"{% endhighlight %}
      <p>By using this method, you can place the framework exactly where you want it to go in your project and maintain your own project folder structure.

	  <h4>Additional Help</h4>
      <p>We found a great little <a class="alert-link"href="http://joncairns.com/2011/10/how-to-use-git-submodules/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Getting Started', 'Download', 'GIT Submodule Tutorial']);">tutorial</a> on submodules in GIT by a fellow named Jon Cairns. If you are having problems you really should have a look at it for some additional pointers.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="download-releases">Release Archive</h3>
    <p>GIT allows us to tag points in the repository, and through a nice feature from the folks at GitHub, we can treat some of those tags as <a href="{{site.repo_releases}}" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Getting Started', 'Download', 'Releases']);">release points</a>, allowing you to access previous releases of Hydrogen. We are not sure why you would, but since it is available why not make it known about, right?
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="callout-less-compilation">
      <h4>Old Versions Not Supported</h4>
      <p>It goes without saying that any of the previous versions we cannot support. If there is a problem, try looking at the repository for any included fixes in that area of the framework.</p>

	<h3 id="included-folders">Folder Structure</h3>
	<p>The framework is organized into numerous sub-folders to aid in keeping things easily found, and in order. At its root you will find the following folders:
	
	 <div class="row">
	  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
	    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></span> Components</h4>
	    <p>Here is where you find some pre-made drag and drop components to drop on to your GameObjects, or you can add them by the quick add button. We've prefixed all of our component based scripts with 'h' so that they can be easily found and identified.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
	    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th-list"></span> Editor</h4>
	    <p>Some fun swag for the Unity Editor, nothing major though.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
	    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase"></span> Extras</h4>
	    <p>This is kind of a storage folder for things that our scripts will utilize automatically for you. We would advise not playing with this folder, hell any folders really, that much.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
    
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
	    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> Plugins</h4>
	    <p>This is where bulk of the code is kept. It is isolated in its own namespace as to not interfere with anything else.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
	    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-picture"></span> Shaders</h4>
	    <p>Pretty self explanatory don't you think?</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
	    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span> Vendors</h4>
	    <p>If we've included something to make your life easier that we didn't particularly make or contribute to; this will be its home. Another way of thinking of what goes here is to associate it to third party additions.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>	
	
	<h3 id="included-third-party">Third Party</h3>	
	<p>As developers we often recognize the excellence of our peers and their efforts in creating amazing products. Sometimes, it makes sense not to try and reinvent the wheel and to stand on the shoulders of others' work. We've included some libraries from other wonderful developers, and have created wrappers to allow for their use in Unity in an amazingly simple workflow.
