     <blockquote>
    <p>TestFlight is a free platform used to distribute beta and internal iOS/Android applications to team members over-the-air. Developers can manage beta testing campaigns and receive feedback from their team with TestFlight's dashboard. With the TestFlight SDK implemented in an application, users can acquire more metrics on how and what testers are doing when testing an application on their device.</p>
  	<small><a href="http://help.testflightapp.com/customer/portal/articles/821656-what-is-testflight-" target="_blank">TestFlight Documentation</a></small>
  </blockquote>
  <p>With that much awesomeness bundled into one package we felt the need to make sure that every Unity developer was able to easily integrate and deploy with TestFlight. Hydrogen's TestFlight component (and supporting scripts) work on the principle of handling as much of the grunt work as possible, allowing you to focus on more important tasks; like making an awesome game.</p>
  <p>The hTestFlight Singleton creates an instance of <code>Hydrogen.Plugins.TestFlight</code> which can be globally accessed via <code>hTestFlight.Instance</code>. As always, this is merely one way of extending on the <code>Hydrogen.Plugins.TestFlight</code> class, as it is designed to be decoupled from everything, you can create your own implementation if you would like (and have the time!).</p>
    <h2 id="plugins-testflight-install">Installation</h2>
    <div class="media">
        <div class="pull-right">

		</div>
		<div class="media-body">
			<p>Inside of the <strong>Assets</strong> menu (on Unity's menu bar!), we have added a <strong>TestFlight</strong> sub-menu; under that we have placed two magical items to automatically complete the install process for both iOS and Android. By selecting either of these options a nice automated installer will popup (with a fancy progress bar) and handle the below processes for you.</p>
			<p>These automated processes rely on the folder structure of Hydrogen not being altered in any way; while you can move the Hydrogen folder wherever you like, its contents need to stay as they are, if you would like the automated installation script to function correctly. If you are eager to install and use a newer version of TestFlight (it takes a little while for the Asset Store to approve a package), you most certainly can replace the library files (iOS v{{site.testflight_ios_version}} / Android v{{site.testflight_android_version}}) found in <strong>Vendors/TestFlight</strong> folder under the packages root.
			
			You can however replace the TestFlight library files found in the <strong>Vendors/TestFlight</strong> folder with newer versions of the library if you do not wish to use the provided versions.   </p>
			<p>We have done our best to try and accommodate for all sorts of scenarios; however we are only human and sometimes things come up that could potentially break the install script. Therefore, we have included the following as a checklist to make sure that the installation has been completed properly.</p>

      <h4>Preprocessor Directive</h4>
      <p>One of the great features about the implementation of TestFlight in Hydrogen is that even with platforms that TestFlight does not support, your code will still work unchanged and it won't include or reference anything that isn't going to be used. This nice treat requires that a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ed8yd1ha.aspx" target="_blank">preprocessor directive</a> (<code>HYDROGEN_TESTFLIGHT</code>) is used. The installation script automatically adds the directive to the <em>Scripting Define Symbols</em> found in <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettings.html" target="_blank">Unity's Player Settings</a> corresponding platform. If you are having problems with getting TestFlight to work, please make sure to double check that your desired platform has the directive added to it's <em>Scripting Define Symbols</em>.</p>

	<p>Now that you have gotten all the installation done, it's time to start rocking away with the actual component! For the sake of documentation it is assumed that you are using the provided hTestFlight component. If you have implemented your own version of the <code>Hydrogen.Plugins.TestFlight</code> class its safe to say that you may not really need to look over these next few sections.</p>
