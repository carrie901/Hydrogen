Hydrogen Framework
================================================================================================

This is a simple to use framework which we use internally. 
We decided to make it free for everyone! 
Hopefully it helps someone out a bit :)

Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Unity 4.x

Included Libraries
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- TestFlight for Android 1.2
- TestFlight for iOS 2.0.2

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are cloning this repository you will more then likely need to copy it into the working 
folder of your Unity project, unless you've included it in as a submodule on your own GIT repo.

A good tutorial for submodules can be found here:

http://joncairns.com/2011/10/how-to-use-git-submodules/

If you've downloaded the Asset Store version, its already installed for you :) The actual repo 
for the Asset Store .unitypackage can be found here:

Folders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Components ###
Here is where you find some pre-made drag and drop components to drop on to your GameObjects, or
you can add them by the quick add button. We've prefixed all of our component based scripts with
'h' so that they can be easily found and identified.

### Editors ###
Some fun swag for the Unity Editor, nothing major though.

### Extras ###
This is kind of a storage folder for things that our scripts will utilize automatically for you.
We would advise not playing with this folder, hell any folders really, that much.

### Plugins ###
This is where bulk of the code is kept. It is isolated in its own namespace as to not interfere
with anything else.

### Shaders ###
Pretty self explanatory don't you think?

### Vendors ###
If we've included something to make your life easier that we didn't particularly make or contribute
to; this will be its home.
