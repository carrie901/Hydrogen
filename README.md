Hydrogen Framework
---------------------------------------------------

This is a simple to use framework which we use internally. We decided to make it free for everyone! 
Hopefully it helps someone out a bit :)


REQUIREMENTS
- Unity 4.x

INSTALLATION
If you are cloning this repository you will more then likely need to copy it 
into the working folder of your Unity project.

If you've downloaded the Asset Store version, its already installed for you :)

SUPPORT
