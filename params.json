{"name":"Hydrogen Framework","tagline":"Bridging the gap between Great and AWESOME!","body":"Hydrogen Framework\r\n================================================================================================\r\n\r\nThis is a simple to use framework which we use internally. \r\nWe decided to make it free for everyone! \r\nHopefully it helps someone out a bit :)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotBunny/Hydrogen/\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n- Unity 4.x\r\n\r\nIncluded Libraries\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n- TestFlight for Android 1.2\r\n- TestFlight for iOS 2.0.2\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are cloning this repository you will more then likely need to copy it into the working \r\nfolder of your Unity project, unless you've included it in as a submodule on your own GIT repo.\r\n\r\nA good tutorial for submodules can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://joncairns.com/2011/10/how-to-use-git-submodules/\r\n\r\nIf you've downloaded the Asset Store version, its already installed for you :) The actual repo \r\nfor the Asset Store .unitypackage can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotBunny/Hydrogen-Package\r\n\r\nFolders\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Components ###\r\nHere is where you find some pre-made drag and drop components to drop on to your GameObjects, or\r\nyou can add them by the quick add button. We've prefixed all of our component based scripts with\r\n'h' so that they can be easily found and identified.\r\n\r\n### Editors ###\r\nSome fun swag for the Unity Editor, nothing major though.\r\n\r\n### Extras ###\r\nThis is kind of a storage folder for things that our scripts will utilize automatically for you.\r\nWe would advise not playing with this folder, hell any folders really, that much.\r\n\r\n### Plugins ###\r\nThis is where bulk of the code is kept. It is isolated in its own namespace as to not interfere\r\nwith anything else.\r\n\r\n### Shaders ###\r\nPretty self explanatory don't you think?\r\n\r\n### Vendors ###\r\nIf we've included something to make your life easier that we didn't particularly make or contribute\r\nto; this will be its home.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAny issues can be reported at http://github.com/dotBunny/Hydrogen/issues\r\n\r\nAutomated documentation can be found at http://hydrogen.dotbunny.com/documentation/\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve created a channel on Vimeo showing off different parts of Hydrogen, check it out at\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/channels/hydrogen\r\n\r\nDue to time commitments to our normal projects, support may be very limited.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
